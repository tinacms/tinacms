![tina-cloud-starter-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103008/130587027-995ccc45-a852-4f90-b658-13e8e0517339.gif)

This Next.js starter is powered by [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) for you and your team to visually live edit the structured content of your website. âœ¨

The content is managed through Markdown and JSON files stored in your GitHub repository, and queried through Tina GraphQL API.

### Features

- [Tina Headless CMS](https://app.tina.io) for authentication, content modeling, visual editing and team management.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) deployment to visually edit your site from the `/admin` route.
- Local development workflow from the filesystem with a local GraqhQL server.

## Requirements

- Git, [Node.js Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), Yarn installed for local development.
- A [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) account for live editing.

## Local Development

Install the project's dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```
yarn dev
```

### Local URLs

- http://localhost:3000 : browse the website
- http://localhost:3000/admin : connect to TinaCloud and go in edit mode
- http://localhost:3000/exit-admin : log out of TinaCloud
- http://localhost:4001/altair/ : GraphQL playground to test queries and browse the API documentation

### Building the Starter Locally (Using the hosted content API)

## Development tips

### Visual Studio Code GraphQL extension

[Install the GraphQL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) to benefit from type auto-completion.

### Typescript

A good way to ensure your components match the shape of your data is to leverage the auto-generated TypeScript types.
These are rebuilt when your `tina` config changes.
