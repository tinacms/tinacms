## About The Guides

The guides featured here will show you how to accomplish specific tasks with Tina. Guides are set up as step-by-step opportunities for learning. They are intended to introduce you to certain APIs, configurations, or workflows and provide rudimentary examples as a reference. Use them to learn the basics, then refer back to the [documentation](/docs) for support in applying general solutions for your distinct needs.

Get support in the [community Discord](https://discord.gg/zumN63Ybpf) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/discussions) at any point.
