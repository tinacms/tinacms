👋 Hey all you cool cats and kittens! It's been a while since our last update, so we wanted to let you know what we've been up to.

## Documentation Cycle Recap

Tina is a toolkit for developers, so documentation is essential. If a feature is not well-documented, it might as well not exist. In light of this, we've spent the past several weeks improving the usability of the documentation on [tinacms.org](https://tinacms.org). We've reorganized the docs and written some new ones, improved the functionality of our search, and are now importing the package docs [directly from GitHub](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/tree/master/packages) to ensure they are always in sync.

Additionally, in an effort to continuously improve our documentation, we've added a **feedback form** at the bottom of our docs. If you're reading a doc that seems incomplete or is difficult to comprehend, go ahead and give us a thumbs down and tell us why!

## Up Next: Media Management

We've decided to begin implementing a Media Manager as described in our [Media API RFC](https://github.com/tinacms/rfcs/blob/master/0003-media-api.md). Currently, the logic for handling uploads is contained within individual image fields, and there's no way to insert a previously-uploaded image into a piece of content. Centralizing media management promises to solve this problem, and likely fix some other quality-of-life issues we've encountered along the way.

If you want to keep tabs on our progress, take a look at the [Media Manager project](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/projects/8) in GitHub.

## TinaCMS Office Hours

**Come hang out with us!**

The Tina Open Source Team will be conducting bi-weekly office hours. Anyone interested in Tina is welcome to drop in with questions or feedback.

Our first office hours session will be on September 11th from 10AM-11AM EDT (7AM-8AM PDT). We plan to alternate between morning and afternoon time slots to accommodate as many timezones as we can.

Keep an eye out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tina_cms) or [our community forum](https://community.tinacms.org/) for the meeting link.
