Feat - Add strikethrough support

- Added a strikethrough button in the rich text editor, allowing users to apply strikethrough formatting.
- Strikethrough syntax (`~~word~~`) correctly applies in Markdown mode.
- **Known Issue:** Typing `~~word~~` does not currently auto-convert to strikethrough in the rich text editor. A fix will follow in an upcoming patch.
