📊 Telemetry - helping us build a better Tina
We’ve added anonymous telemetry to `⁠create-tina-app`. This helps our team understand which environments (Node version, OS, Package Manager) and starter templates are most popular so we can prioritize the right features and fixes.
Privacy First: We never collect personal data or project-specific code.
Opt-out: Prefer to stay off the grid? You can disable this at any time by passing the `⁠--noTelemetry` flag.
