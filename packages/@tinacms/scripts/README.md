# @tinacms/scripts

This package provides the `tinacms-scripts` bin with the following commands:

| Command               | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tinacms-scripts build | Builds the package for production use (i.e. uglified and without debugging) |
| tinacms-scripts watch | Watches the package for updates and rebuilds.                               |


The best way to work with this library is to run it from the root of the repository so all packages are watched in a single process. Refer to the top-level `package.json` for instructions.
