# _next-tinacms-azure_

Manage **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage media assets** in TinaCMS.

## Installation

### With Yarn

```bash
yarn add next-tinacms-azure
```

### With NPM

```bash
npm install next-tinacms-azure
```

## Connect with Azure Storage

You will need a Microsoft Azure subscription for this plugin. You can [get one here](https://azure.microsoft.com/). In this subscription you should create at least one resource group within which you should create an Azure Blob Storage account. You can use this storage account's blob storage service to manage your TinaCMS media.

**next-tinacms-azure** uses environment variables within the context of a Next.js site to properly access your Microsoft Azure blob storage account.

Add the following variables to an `.env` file.

```
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=<Your Blob Storage Account connection string, obtained from the Azure Portal>
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=<The name of the Blob Storage container to host your media>
```

## Register the Media Store

Now, you can register the Azure Media store with the instance of Tina in your app by passing the `TinaCloudAzureMediaStore` to the `TinaCMS` instance via its `mediaStore` prop.

This is also where we can update our `mediaOptions` on the cms object.

```tsx
// Typically in the tina/config.ts file of a Next.js project

import { defineConfig } from "tinacms";

export default defineConfig({
  media: {
    loadCustomStore: async () => {
      const pack = await import("next-tinacms-azure");
      return pack.TinaCloudAzureMediaStore;
    },
  },
  // other configuration options
});

...
```

## Set up API routes

This package is built for the new App Router. Set up a catch all API route for media as an API route, e.g. as `app/api/azure/[...media]/route.ts`.

Call `createMediaHandler` to set up routes and connect your instance of the Media Store to your Azure Storage account.

Import `isAuthorized` from `next-tinacms-azure`.

The `authorized` key will make it so only authorized users within Tina Cloud can upload and make media edits.

```ts
// route.ts

import { createMediaHandlers } from 'next-tinacms-azure/dist/handlers'
import { isAuthorized } from 'next-tinacms-azure/dist/auth'

const handlers = createMediaHandlers({
  connectionString: process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING!,
  containerName: process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME!,
  authorized: async (req) => {
    try {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV == 'development') {
        return true
      }

      const user = await isAuthorized(req)

      return user?.verified || false
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e)
      return false
    }
  },
})

const { GET, POST, DELETE } = handlers

export { GET, POST, DELETE }
```

## Set up media delivery routes

Media links are stored as relative URLs under `/media/`. For example, if a blob's actual URL is:

```
https://accountname.blob.core.windows.net/containername/folder1/folder2/filename.jpg
```

The URL registered with TinaCMS will be:

```
/media/folder1/folder2/filename.jpg
```

To fetch the actual blob from Azure Storage, an API route responding to this URL will be required.

To simplify this process, you can use the `createMediaDeliveryHandlers ` function from the `next-tinacms-azure/dist/delivery-handlers` package. Set up a catch-all API route (e.g., `app/api/media/[...path]/route.ts`) and use the following code:

```ts
// route.ts

import { createMediaDeliveryHandlers } from 'next-tinacms-azure/dist/delivery-handlers'

const handlers = createMediaDeliveryHandlers({
  connectionString: process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING!,
  containerName: process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME!,
  authorized: async () => {
    return true
  },
})

const { GET } = handlers

export { GET }
```

The above route will handle all requests to `/api/media/xxxx/yyyy.zzz`. To map it to `/media/xxxx/yyyy.zzz` we need to add a rewrite to the project's `next.config.mjs` file like so:

```mjs
const nextConfig = {
  // other config here
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/media/:path*',
        destination: '/api/media/:path*',
      },
      // more rewrites here
    ]
  },
}
```

Note that the provided handler has built in support for image resizing and optimization according to the Next.js `next/image` loader directives, using the [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) package.

## Update Schema

Now that the media store is registered and the API route for media set up, let's add an image to your schema.

In your `tina/config.ts` add a new field for the image, e.g:

```
 {
  name: 'hero',
  type: 'image',
  label: 'Hero Image',
 }
```

Now, when editing your site, the image field will allow you to connect to your Azure Blob Storage account via the Media Store to manage your media assets.
