      Founded by Terrence Mahon and Jennifer Rhines, and spurred on by our team
      of professional runners, Golden Coast Track Club is about teaching
      athletes the fundamentals of sport and life. As the name suggests we are
      located on the California Coast in San Diego, but no one is limited from
      joining our athletic community.


      GCTC offers online running plans, health & wellness guides, and strength
      programs so people all over the world have the opportunity to get
      involved. These programs range from fundamental to highly individualized,
      with access to information provided by world class coaches and athletes.


      We believe the path to success is found through a holistic approach to
      training and a strong sense of community. This culture is what fuels GCTC,
      and helps our runners to stay committed to their athletic endeavors. By
      joining our team you are taking the first step in breaking down barriers
      and achieving your goals.
